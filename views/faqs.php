        <h4>What is the dress code?</h4>
        <p>We think of Dinner in the Woods as the kick off to summer event! While most dress up a bit, khakis, a dress -- whatever is YOU,
        please be sure to dress for the weather and wear shoes that will be comfortable to move around on our beautiful lawn.
            It will cool as the evening goes, so bring a sweater or jacket!</p>
        <h4>Parking</h4>
        <p>Through a generous donation from one of our supporters, valet parking will be provided again this year. Please pull up the driveway until you see the attendants.</p>
        <h4>School and Farm tours</h4>
        <p>We are most proud of our school and our students who make this space so special. We would love to show you our facility and are offering tours
            at 6:00 p.m. and 6:30 p.m. If you would like to come along for a tour please meet by the front school doors at either of those times.</p>
        <h4>What are Ticket Enhancers?</h4>
        <p>Ticket Enhancers are the way to get in on more fun throughout the evening. You can spend these at the bar, for chances at our raffle items
            or for the wine and egg pull. Ticket enhancers are $2 each and sold in packs of 10 ($20).</p>
        <h4>What is a Wine Pull?</h4>
        <p>For each Wine Pull ticket you purchase(=5 ticket enhancers)  you will "pull" (select) a mystery bottle of wine  (valued at least at $10) to take home.</p>
        <h4>What is the Egg Pull?</h4>
        <p>For each Egg Pull ticket  you purchase (=2  ticket enhancers)  you have the chance to win XXX Dozen of eggs from our farm! Chicken and turkey eggs are up for your chance to win!</p>
        <h4>What is a Cabana?</h4>
        <p>Once the main festivities are complete for the evening, the band and dancing will officially begin and some guests have enjoyed moving to a cabana for a special dessert and cocktail.
            Relax there and enjoy the evening under the stars! Purchase of a cabana entitles you to a pitcher of our signature Dinner In The Woods cocktail and a gourmet dessert.</p>
        <h4> Are dietary restrictions accommodated?</h4>
        <p>We have a vegan meal option available. When your ticket or table was purchased this may have already been selected. If you are not sure or know that it was not indicated,
            please email <a href="mailto:deepa@nciw.org">deepa@nciw.org</a> to ensure we have this counted in our planning.

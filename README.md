### Setting up Apache

Nothing special is required for Apache to work. We've include the `.htaccess` file in the `public` folder. If rewriting is not working for you, please check that the `mod_rewrite` module (htaccess support) is enabled in the Apache configuration.

#### .htaccess example

Below is an example of an working `.htaccess` file used by simple-php-router.

Simply create a new `.htaccess` file in your projects `public` directory and paste the contents below in your newly created file. This will redirect all requests to your `index.php` file (see Configuration section below).

```
RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{SCRIPT_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{SCRIPT_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteCond %{SCRIPT_FILENAME} !-l
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php/$1
```
